2. Define the difference between narrow AI (weak AI) and general AI (strong AI), and provide examples of each.
// Student answer: Narrow AI refers to systems designed for specific tasks, like voice assistants or game-playing computers. General AI would possess human-like intelligence across all cognitive domains. Examples include Siri for narrow AI, and hypothetical AGI systems for general AI.

3. Explain the concept of knowledge representation in AI systems. How is it different from data storage?
// Student answer: Knowledge representation refers to the methods used by AI systems to represent information in a way that's meaningful for reasoning and problem-solving. Unlike simple data storage, KR involves organizing facts into structures like semantic networks, ontologies, or logical frameworks.

4. What are the key differences between machine learning and traditional programming?
// Student answer: Machine learning allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming of all possible outcomes, while traditional programming requires hand-coded rules for specific tasks. ML uses statistical methods and algorithms that improve with experience.

5. Describe the major limitations of current AI systems in terms of common sense reasoning.
// Student answer: Current AI systems struggle with understanding context, drawing reasonable conclusions based on incomplete information, making intuitive leaps, and processing abstract concepts like humor or metaphors.

6. What is the difference between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning?
// Student answer: Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn patterns; unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data; reinforcement learning learns by trial-and-error through reward-based feedback.

7. How does symbolic AI differ from connectionist (neural network) approaches?
// Student answer: Symbolic AI represents knowledge as explicit symbols and rules, while connectionist AI relies on interconnected neural networks that learn through weighted connections between nodes.

8. What are the key components of an expert system?
// Student answer: An expert system consists of a knowledge base, inference engine, user interface, and domain-specific algorithms to mimic human expertise in a particular field.

9. Describe the basic principles of heuristic search algorithms.
// Student answer: Heuristic search uses rules of thumb or educated guesses to guide the search for solutions more efficiently than exhaustive methods. It evaluates partial solutions based on estimated cost to goal.

10. What is the significance of the Turing Test in AI development?
// Student answer: The Turing Test established a benchmark for evaluating machine intelligence by determining if a human evaluator can distinguish between machine and human responses during natural language conversations.

11. How do neural networks learn patterns in data?
// Student answer: Neural networks learn through adjusting connection weights based on input-output pairs, using backpropagation to minimize prediction errors across training examples.

12. What are the main types of learning algorithms used in AI?
// Student answer: Common learning algorithms include linear regression for supervised learning, k-means clustering for unsupervised learning, and Q-learning for reinforcement learning.

13. Explain the concept of machine learning bias and its potential consequences.
// Student answer: Bias in ML occurs when models learn patterns that reflect existing biases in training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in real-world applications.

14. What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?
// Student answer: Machine learning encompasses all supervised/unsupervised learning methods, while deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks with millions of parameters to automatically learn representations from raw data.

15. How does natural language processing differ from general AI?
// Student answer: NLP focuses on understanding and generating human-like text, rather than achieving general intelligence or consciousness. It's a narrow application area within the broader field of AI.

16. What are the key limitations of current natural language processing systems?
// Student answer: Current NLP systems struggle with understanding context, sarcasm, idioms, and nuanced emotional content in text; they often produce grammatically correct but semantically incorrect responses.

17. Explain the concept of knowledge engineering and its role in expert system development.
// Student answer: Knowledge engineering involves extracting relevant information from domain experts to create structured knowledge bases for AI systems, requiring careful data validation and representation selection.

18. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in practice?
// Student answer: Supervised learning requires labeled training examples (input-output pairs), while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled input data only, using patterns discovered to form clusters or structures.

19. How does reinforcement learning differ from other machine learning approaches?
// Student answer: Reinforcement learning learns through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, receiving rewards for desired behaviors and penalties for undesired ones, without explicit training labels.

20. What are the main challenges in developing general artificial intelligence?
// Student answer: Key challenges include creating systems that can learn, reason, adapt, and generalize across diverse domains; understand context, emotions, and human-like abstract thinking; and maintain continuous learning capabilities.

21. Explain the concept of transfer learning in machine learning.
// Student answer: Transfer learning involves training a model on one task or dataset and then adapting it for use in another related but different task by fine-tuning its parameters.

22. What is the significance of neural network architectures like CNNs and RNNs?
// Student answer: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image processing through local connectivity patterns, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) handle sequential data using internal memory states to maintain temporal context.

23. How does AI ethics differ from traditional software engineering ethics?
// Student answer: AI ethics must address unique challenges like bias in automated systems, transparency in decision-making processes, and accountability for AI-driven outcomes that impact human lives.

24. What are the main limitations of current computer vision systems?
// Student answer: Computer vision systems struggle with understanding fine-grained details, generalizing to new object categories, handling complex lighting conditions, and processing real-time video efficiently.

25. Explain the concept of probabilistic reasoning in AI.
// Student answer: Probabilistic reasoning involves using probability theory to represent uncertainty in knowledge bases and decision-making processes, allowing AI systems to reason about possible outcomes with quantified likelihoods.

26. What is the difference between supervised classification and regression?
// Student answer: Classification predicts discrete class labels (categories), while regression estimates continuous values (quantities) based on input features.

27. How does explainability in machine learning differ from other forms of software transparency?
// Student answer: Explainable AI systems provide interpretable models that highlight feature importance, decision paths, and confidence levels, making their internal reasoning more transparent to users.

// Student answer: Challenges include integrating multiple sensor modalities for robust perception, developing efficient planning algorithms for complex tasks, ensuring safe human-robot interaction, and managing power consumption limitations.

29. Explain the concept of cognitive architectures in AI.
// Student answer: Cognitive architectures model information processing systems with parallel symbol-manipulation processes (working memory, long-term memory), reasoning mechanisms, goal-oriented behavior, and learning capabilities.

30. What are the potential implications of advanced AI systems on human employment?
// Student answer: Advanced AI systems may automate certain jobs but create new ones in areas like AI development, ethics consulting, and specialized human-AI interaction design, requiring workforce retraining and adaptation strategies.
